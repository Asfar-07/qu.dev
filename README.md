## 🧩 What is qu.dev?

Building surveys into a project sounds simple — until you have to design the database yourself.

How should the tables relate? Where does versioning live? How do you add question types without breaking existing responses?

**qu.dev** solves this. It automatically generates a best-practice relational database schema for your survey system and gives you a full web interface to build, manage, version, and test surveys — without writing a single entity from scratch.

## 🗄️ Database Structure

qu.dev automatically creates and manages the following relational schema:

```
surveys
└── survey_versions          → Version history per survey
    └── user_survey_sessions → User session tracking per version
        └── questions        → Questions linked to each version
            ├── options      → Answer options per question
            └── responses    → Stored user responses per session
```

> The schema is designed to be clean, extendable, and easy to integrate into any existing Spring Boot project.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Connect your database** — configure your MySQL connection from the Connection page
2. **Create a survey** — add a name, key, and description
3. **Build questions** — add questions with types, options, and required flags
4. **Version your survey** — save changes as a new version to preserve existing response data
5. **Test it** — use the built-in demo testing environment to validate your survey before going live
6. **Integrate** — copy the auto-generated entity and service code into your Spring Boot project

> Requires basic knowledge of relational databases and REST API integration to connect your backend.

---

## 🔗 Integration

If you're using Spring Boot, you can copy the entity and service logic directly from qu.dev into your project. The schema is designed to plug in cleanly with minimal changes.

```java
// Example: fetch active survey with version
surveyRepository.findByKeyAndActiveTrue("user_onboarding");
```
